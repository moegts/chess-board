## Problem Domain: 

constructing chess boards like it’s 1980, to render out chess boards with red and blue queens on them.
Each board will have one red and one blue queen at different coordinates.
In addition to displaying the board you’ll need to identify if the queens are “under attack” based on their coordinates.
